User Account System
========
* Passwords hashed with scrypt
* Personas separated from authentication (shared accounts built-in)
* No contact information stored with authentication
  * This means if you forget your password, you're boned
  * But if pressured by law enforcement, we can't conclusively say which account made the post under the persona
